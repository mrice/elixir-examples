A *very* nascent collection of [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org) examples along with their unit tests.

About these exercises
---
I'm totally new to Elixir and Erlang, but I think it's pretty cool so far. Since I'm so new, surely the code needs lots and lots and lots of work to make it truly an examplary example site. Please submit issues or pull requests!
